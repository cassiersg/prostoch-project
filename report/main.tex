\section*{Question 1}
\subsection*{Deriving $\ubar{\ubar{F}}$ and $\ubar{U}$}
The relative state vector is defined by $\ubar{x} := \ubar{x^t} - \ubar{x^0}$, with $\ubar{x^t}$ the state vector of the target (unknown) and $\ubar{x^0}$ the state 
vector of the observer (known).

Under the hypothesis of uniform acceleration,  with $x_k$ being the position at time k and with a time step $T$, in one dimension :
\[x_{k+1}= x_k + T\dot{x}_k + \frac{T^2}{2}\ddot{x}_k 
\hspace{3cm}
 \dot{x}_{k+1} =  \dot{x}_k+ T\ddot{x}_k  
\]

Hence in the plane : 
\[\ubar{x}_{k+1} = \ubar{\ubar{F}}\ubar{x}_k - \ubar{U}_{k,k+1} + \ubar{\epsilon}_k 
\]

\[ \colvec{4}{x_{k+1}}{y_{k+1}}{\dot{x_{k+1}}}{\dot{y_{k+1}}} =  
	\begin{pmatrix}
	    1 & 0 & T & 0 \\
	    0 & 1 & 0 & T \\   
	    0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
	    0 & 0 & 0 & 1   
	\end{pmatrix}
	\colvec{4}{x_{k}}{y_{k}}{\dot{x_{k}}}{\dot{y_{k}}}
-
	\colvec{4}{\frac{T^2}{2}\ddot{x}_k }{\frac{T^2}{2}\ddot{y}_k }{T\ddot{x}_k}{T\ddot{y}_k}
+ 
	\epsilon_k
\]
As it is stated that the velocity of the target is nearly constant, the acceleration of the target is close to zero. The acceleration
vector is then equal to minus the acceleration of the observer,  
\[ \ddot{x}_{k,k+1} = - \ddot{x}^0_{k,k+1} = \frac{\dot{x}^0_{k}-\dot{x}^0_{k+1}}{2(x^0_{k+1}-x^0_{k})} = \kappa_{k,k+1} 
\]
\[ \ddot{y}_{k,k+1} = - \ddot{y}^0_{k,k+1} = \frac{\dot{y}^0_{k}-\dot{y}^0_{k+1}}{2(y^0_{k+1}-y^0_{k})} = \upsilon_{k,k+1} 
\]

In the end : 
\[ \ubar{\ubar{F}} =  
\begin{pmatrix}
    1 & 0 & T & 0 \\
    0 & 1 & 0 & T \\   
    0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 1   
\end{pmatrix}
\hspace{3cm}
 \ubar{U}_{k,k+1} = 
\colvec{4}{\frac{T^2}{2}\kappa_{k,k+1}}{\frac{T^2}{2} \upsilon_{k,k+1}}{T\kappa_{k,k+1}}{T \upsilon_{k,k+1}}
\]
\subsection*{Deriving $h(\ubar{x})$}
Following its definition given in the statement and using ($1$) as the first index of the vector $\ubar{x}$ : 
\[ h(\ubar{x}_k) = \arctan\frac{x_k(1)}{x_k(2)} 
\]
